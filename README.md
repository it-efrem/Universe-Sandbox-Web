### Description

Universe Sandbox 2D Web is an interactive space sandbox gravity simulator video game and educational software. Using Universe Sandbox 2D Web, users can see the effects of gravity on objects in the universe and run scale simulations of the Solar System, various galaxies or other simulations, while at the same time interacting and maintaining control over gravity, time, and other objects in the universe, such as moons, planets, asteroids, comets, and black holes. Universe Sandbox 2D Web available for Windows, macOS, and Linux as web-application.
